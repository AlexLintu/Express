## Notes:

1. Create a root folder `express-and-react`
2. `cd` into the newly created folder
3. Create a `README` document
4. Create a `package.json` file by running `npm init`
5. Update `package.json` (if needed)
6. Install dependencies and add them to the `package.json` file by running `npm i express concurrently --save`. This will create `package-lock.json` file automatically
7. Install `npm i nodemon --save-dev` to update the app automatically
8. Add `scripts` to `package.json`
9. Create a `server.js` and add express server into it with at least one route
10. `npm run server` to run the script we created that runs and watches the `server.js`
11.
